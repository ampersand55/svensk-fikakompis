This is a Swedish conversation AI bot with a built-in language checker/tutor.

I made this for a friend, but I might as well share it here too.

A conversation with a real Swede or a tutor is obviously better. But this is for people who might not be able to find a Swedish-speaking conversation partner, or are too shy to speak Swedish at their current level.

This is a Swedish conversation bot with two modes:

* The main mode is Svensk fikakompis ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª, a Swedish-speaking conversation partner. It starts with simple sentences, then adapts to mirror your displayed level of Swedish proficiency.
* A "tutor mode", speaking your preferred language, that triggers on language mistakes are found in your main Swedish conversation. It corrects the mistake(s), briefly explains why, and offers helpful advice to help you avoid similar mistakes in the future.

This is a set of instructions intended to use in a custom AI prompt, which is available on many mayor chatbots under different names, e.g.:

* [Google Gemini - Gem](https://gemini.google.com/gems/create)
* [Chat GPT - GPT](https://chatgpt.com/gpts)
* [Grok - Project](https://grok.com/project)
* [Claude - Artifact](https://claude.ai/artifacts/my)
* [Perplexity - Space](https://www.perplexity.ai/spaces/)
